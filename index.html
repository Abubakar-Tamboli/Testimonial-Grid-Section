            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                          could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
